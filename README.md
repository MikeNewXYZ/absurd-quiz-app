## How it works!

### ðŸŽ¨ So many styles??!?!
[![random theme function](./assets/random-theme.png)](./client/src/lib/random-theme.js)
I had the slightly crazy idea that the style of the page should change on every refresh and also with user interaction. This was achived by using DaisyUI which comes with a huge array of preset themes. All I had to do then was to set a different theme on page initialization and whenever else I felt like it. This is done with a very simple function that you can see above.

## ðŸ¤– How are the questions generated?
[![chatgpt api](./assets/openai-api.png)](./server/server.js)
The quiz is generated using ChatGPT, specifically using the "GPT 3.5 Turbo" model, using the OpenAI API. It simply takes in [instructions from a text file](./server/instructions.txt) and using that outputs a response in JSON. The response should contain an array of 5 questions all with a title and answers array.

## ðŸ•º How is the end sequence animated?
[![end sequence](./assets/end-sequence.png)](./client/src/slides/summary-slide.js)
The terminal from the end sequence is simply a component from DaisyUI. The animations however, was created using an [NPM library called typewriter-effect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typewriter-effect). It has a very simple but powerful API allowing me to quickly build the fun end animation. The .callFunction method allowing me to call the "jsConfetti.addConfetti()" function as much as I so pleased.
